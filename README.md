# LC3 Virtual CPU

This is a *pure* Go implementation of the LC3 Virtual CPU [found here](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) with zero dependencies other than the Go standard library.

## Usage

`go build -o lc3 main.go`
`./lc3 <some-binary-file>`

## Binaries

1. [2048](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/supplies/2048.obj)
1. [Rogue](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/supplies/rogue.obj) 

Feel free to let me know if there is anything I can do to improve my implementation!
